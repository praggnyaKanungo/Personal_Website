# My Terminal-Style Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website designed to look and function like a terminal interface. As a CS major, researcher, and teacher, I wanted my portfolio to reflect my technical background while presenting my skills and projects in a unique, interactive way.

## Features

- **Interactive Terminal Interface**: Navigate through my portfolio using terminal commands
- **Dynamic Animated Background**: Stars and network visualization effects
- **Custom Boot Sequence**: Cool loading animation when you first enter the terminal
- **Welcome Page**: Brief introduction with a typewriter effect before entering the terminal
- **Command-Based Navigation**: Use commands like `ls`, `cd`, `cat`, etc. to explore my portfolio
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on various screen sizes

## Commands

Once in the terminal, you can use these commands to navigate my portfolio:

- `help` - Display a list of available commands
- `about` - Learn about me and my background
- `skills` - View my technical skills
- `projects` - See my portfolio projects
- `education` - View my educational background
- `teaching` - Learn about my teaching experience
- `research` - Explore my research experience
- `contact` - Get my contact information
- `clear` - Clear the terminal screen

## Technologies I Used for This Site

- React
- Styled Components
- Vite
- SVG animations
- CSS animations and keyframes

## Development

I built this portfolio using React and styled-components to create a terminal-like interface with modern web technologies. The background features constellation-like star animations and a network visualization effect for a professional yet impressive look.

## Deployment

This site is deployed using GitHub Pages and can be accessed at [https://praggnyakanungo.github.io/Personal_Website/](https://praggnyakanungo.github.io/Personal_Website/)

## Future Enhancements

I plan to add more interactive features and projects to my portfolio as I continue to grow as a developer and researcher.

## Special Thank Yous!

I would like to give  special thank you to my peer, Geethan Sundaram who gave me this idea of creating a personal website that resembles a terminal. It was a idea that really stuck with me, and he encouraged me to make it myself.
